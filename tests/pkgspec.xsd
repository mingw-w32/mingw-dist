    Note to maintainers, (because this may seem counter intuitive, and
    thus may be eminently forgettable): whilst the structure of any XML
    document demands that attributes be specified in the opening tag of
    their associated element, and thus they PRECEDE the element content,
    XSDL requires that they be declared AFTER the corresponding content
    model; please ensure that their declarations are correctly placed
    within this XSDL schema.
